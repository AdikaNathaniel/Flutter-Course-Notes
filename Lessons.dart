1.Flutter is an SDK for building applications for various platforms from one codebase. 
2.Dart is the programming language. 
3.Compilation is the transformation of source code which is human readable into machine code which is computer executable. 
4.Native code is code specific to a particular platform like Swift is native for Ios. 
5.So flutter renders the app and not the platform.
