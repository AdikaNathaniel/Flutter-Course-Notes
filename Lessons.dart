1.Flutter is an SDK for building applications for various platforms from one codebase. 
2.Dart is the programming language. 
3.Compilation is the transformation of source code which is human readable into machine code which is computer executable. 
4.Native code is code specific to a particular platform like Swift is native for Ios. 
5.So flutter renders the app and not the platform. 
6.Recall that Andriod Studio or Vscode can be used as IDE for a flutter
project.
7.The emulator needs Andriod Studio to works with it.
8.To enable flutter for web :
  -- flutter config --enable-web
9.The materialApp is the root of the widget Tree.
10.Same way you wrap a widget with another widget,that
is the same way to remove a widget.
Press Alt and Enter at once for this.
11.Scaffold is the skeleton on which other widgets are built.
12.Release Mode is for production whilst Debug mode is 
for Testing purposes.
   debugShowCheckedModeBanner : false
13.Flutter Icon is used to change the icon that shows to open the app.
14.Quick boot is when after Andriod Studio is boot,
it retrieves all old files open but for Cold boot all no-saved files
are lost.
15.Hot reload updates a change instantly but Hot Restart starts the app again
with the new updates in the app.
16.Dart Pad is a website to write dart code.
17.List is a collection of similar datatypes stored  in 
contiguous memory locations.
A contiguous memory location means that data is stored in 
consecutive (adjacent) memory addresses, one right after the other, with no gaps in between.
